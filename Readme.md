# JPG2PDF

This short script will allow you to convert picture files (jpg, gif, png) to one pdf file.

# Usage

  Just run this executable/python file from within a folder containing the pictures you want to convert to pdf.


Notes:
  - each run makes one pdf file containing all pictures (png,gif,jpg) in the current folder.
  - no sorting as of now (which pic comes first)
